          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            This is a coding project developed for RideCell by Gary Guo on October 23rd, 2016.
            <br><br>Architect and implement the backend for a street parking reservation system for mobile apps to use. You can use any language or platform. Support the following features:<br><br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>User registration &amp; login</b>: New users should be able to create a new account using their email address, set up a password, and set up their phone number.
              <ul>
                <li>Bonus: Integrate with an OAuth service and use that for registration and authentication.</li>
                <li>Bonus: Accept credit cards for payments (feel free to use third party libraries like Stripe or Braintree)</li>
                <li>Bonus: Validate that phone numbers are real (feel free to use third party libraries like Twilio or Plivo)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Parking spot viewing &amp; search interface</b>: Provide APIs for users to be able to see available parking spots on a map, search for an address and find nearby unreserved parking, and see how much a particular parking spot costs.
              <ul>
                <li>Bonus: Enforce a maximum/minimum length of time that the parking spot can be reserved</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Parking spot reservation</b>: Users should be able to reserve a parking spot, view their reservation, and cancel it. Note that reservation should start immediately.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Endpoints</h4>
          <p>The following links provide boiler plate UI for the REST endpoints.</p>
